# Security 💕

We take the utmost care to secure our systems and protect our users, but software is volatile and the world isn't perfect.  If you discover a security vulnerability notify us immediately so we can take care of it.

✔️ If it's a relatively insignificant vulnerability you can create a new [issue](https://github.com/miamatriarx/miamatriarx/issues).\
✔️ If it's a critical vulnerability then don't create an issue or publicly expose it, doing so can potentially be harmful to users, directly [contact](https://github.com/miamatriarx/miamatriarx/blob/main/support.md) us instead.

If you aren't sure then rather contact us directly.

Provide as much information as you can, including what exactly the issue is, the device or browser that you're using, what you were busy doing when you noticed the issue and if possible the steps or setup to reproduce the behaviour.  Providing us with as much information as possible helps us to figure out what exactly the vulnerability is and how to fix it.
