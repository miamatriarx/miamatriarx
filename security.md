# Security ðŸ’•

We try to keep our systems secure and to protect our users, but software is volatile and far from perfect.  If you discover a security vulnerability notify us immediately so we can take care of it.

If you have found an issue related to security then don't create a public issue for it, doing so could potentially put users at risk, directly [contact](https://github.com/miamatriarx/miamatriarx/blob/main/support.md) us instead with as much information as you can about the issue.
