## 🏰 Community 🌈

✔️ Authenticity - Be honest, be genuine, be trustworthy, be vulnerable, be yourself; There's no such thing as the ideal person, we cherish and celebrate diversity and what makes you special and unique.\
✔️ Integrity - Be wholesome, be honourable, be responsible towards you commitments, uphold justice, don't be morally corrupt, do the right thing.\
✔️ Respect - Be considerate, be tolerant, don't force things on others, don't try to control others, don't lie to others, make sure you have consent, try to understand a point of view or perspective even if you don't agree with it, have regard for others and their feelings, acknowledge and validate others, let your actions be constructive towards others.\
✔️ Responsibility - Hold yourself accountable, take ownership of the things you do, fulfil your duties, stay loyal to your obligations or commitments, take initiative when you see it's required and take action.\
✔️ Collaboration - Work together as a team, compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses, utilize each other's resources, share in the collective pool of experience, knowledge, creativity, innovation and ideas, be willing to help, don't be scared to ask for help.\
✔️ Diversity - Cherish and celebrate those different from you, biologically or mentally, be inclusive of everyone regardless of anything, don't discriminate against anyone, we all come from different backgrounds and experiences with different views and perceptions of the world, take the time to genuinely understand someone and where they're coming from, learn from others and let them teach you something, listen and take in things beyond what you think you already know, you don't always have to agree with someone or believe everything they believe in order for them to be a great team member and an invaluable contributor, most often they will think of something you missed or didn't know about or come up with an idea you didn't consider, diversity is our greatest strength in biological and mental evolution, as well as innovation, scientific breakthroughs and making progress as a species.\
✔️ Education - Acquire knowledge, gain experience, learn or improve on a skill, expand your mind, become more aware, take responsibility for your education and become autodidactic, realize that every single thing you consume is constantly changing the structure of your brain and altering your perception of reality, be mindful of the things you consume, do at least one thing every day that ameliorates your mind.\
✔️ Empowerment - Stand up for yourself and your rights, love and take care of yourself, do things that are beneficial for you and your mental and emotional health, do things that will improve on the quality of your life, also do the same for others, empower others through mentoring, teaching or supporting them, hold their hand a little if they need it, accommodate people and give them the space they need to be the best version of themselves, if they are in doubt give them a little inspiration, motivation or encouragement, let your actions towards yourself and others be constructive.\
✔️ Freedom - Empower yourself, stand up for yourself, don't tolerate being subjected to suppression or oppression, don't force things on others, don't try to control others, respect people's consent, contribute to things that make yourself and others free.\
✔️ Altruism - Don't be selfish, egotistical or self-centered, sometimes it's okay to be a little selfish, at times it's required, but care about those around you and how your actions affect everyone else and not just yourself, care about the rest of the world and society and not just about yourself, you have an intrinsic moral obligation towards the rest of our species.\
✔️ Compassion - Love and care for yourself, take care of yourself, be kind towards yourself, also do the same for others, be sympathetic, be mindful of how your actions or words might make others feel, be aware of the suffering of others and try to relieve it if possible, be supportive towards others.\
✔️ Action - Take the initiative, do something, don't just complain or moan or point fingers or expect that someone else will fix it, take action, take the lead, nothing changes without taking practical and tangible action.
